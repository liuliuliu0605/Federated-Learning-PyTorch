In GML file the distance is the latency indicated in the original files (latencies.intra).
The details of each instance is as follows (which is a little bit different from the statistics in the paper):
                 num_of_nodes             num_of_links
1221                 108                     153
1239                 315                     972
1755                 87                      161
3257                 161                     328
3967                 79                      147
6461                 141                     374
1755+3967            166                     327


The combined one "1755+3967": 19 random edges are added. The latency is calculated by distance which is normalized compared with the original maximum latency weight.
